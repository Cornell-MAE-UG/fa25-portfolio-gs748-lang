My name is Gwendolyn, and I am a mechanical engineering student. I have a strong interest in robotics and CAD. I enjoy applying problem-solving skills to technical challenges and exploring how engineering principles can be used to design innovative and practical solutions. I am excited to continue building my skills while contributing to work that makes a positive impact in both engineering and society.
