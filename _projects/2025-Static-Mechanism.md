For a class project, we were tasked with designing and modeling a lifting mechanism within a fixed 2D design space of 150 cm by 50 cm. The goal was to create a frame that could lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height using one rigid bar, three pin supports (two grounded), and a single linear actuator chosen from an online catalog.

My final design had a 150 cm bar that was pinned to a linear actuator. That was supported by a 50 cm bar that was pinned to the ground.

Static equilibrium calculations and simple force analysis were used to estimate the maximum liftable load, which depended on the actuator’s force rating and the lever arm ratios. The model demonstrated the trade-off between lifting force and vertical displacement, showing how small changes in actuator placement significantly affected performance.
