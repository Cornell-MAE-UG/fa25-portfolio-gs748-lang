The device we chose was a counterflow heat exchanger. Hot water is pumped through one side of the heat exchanger, and cold water is pumped through the other. In a counterflow heat exchanger, the hot and cold flows meet at the ends of the heat exchanger. As the hot and cold fluids move through the heat exchanger, heat flows from the hot fluid to the cold fluid because the two fluids have a temperature difference. Since opposing fluids move in counter-current scenarios, the temperature difference existing between the two fluids is maintained at a higher value in the case of a counter-current flow heat exchanger. Thus, the rate of heat transfer will also be higher due to this process.

A higher mass flow rate of one of the fluid streams increases the fluid velocity and improves the convective heat transfer, which raises the overall heat transfer coefficient. However, the higher flow rate also raises the thermal capacity rate, so more energy is used by the fluid to change its temperature. Therefore, there is a smaller temperature change between the inlet and the outlet for the stream having the larger mass flow rate and a larger temperature change for the stream having the smaller flow rate. Ultimately, this affects the heat transfer rate as well as the outlet temperature in the heat exchanger.
